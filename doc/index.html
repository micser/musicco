									<p>But basically, songs will be detected in any folder in your library.</p>
									<p>No files are modified. No id3 tags are read. The only modifications made in your library folder are that a cover is downloaded if none exists when a song is played for the first time.</p>
									<p>Use the filter text to filter the top folders</p>

									<h2>Authentication and Sharing</h2>
									<p>You can (and probably should) require a login for musicco. There are two levels of users: guests and administrators. The main difference is that guest accounts do not have the right to update the music library or download individual tracks. When a login is required, your playlists are saved across sessions for your user only.</p>
									<p>Want to share a permalink to an album? You can do that by clicking the link icon in the playlist. You will get a link to the album that you can open in a guest session.</p>

									</ul>
									<h3>Installation</h3>
									<ol>
										<li>Extract the distribution archive into the root of your webserver</li>
										<li>Place your music in the music folder or create a symbolic link to the root of your music directory to replace the music folder</li>
										<li>Open up a browser, complete the setup wizard and click on "Update Library". It may take a few minutes for this operation to finish if you have several thousand files.</li>

									<h2>For Advanced Users</h2>
									<h4>Automating Library Rebuilds</h4>
									<p>Instead of manually clicking and waiting for the library to rebuild itself, you can use a cronjob to trigger an update by calling index.php with the parameter builddb</p>
									<p>The example below shows how to trigger a library rebuild every night at midnight:</p>
									<p>0 0 * * * "/bin/cd /srv/wwwroot/musicco && /bin/php /srv/wwwroot/musicco/index.php builddb >> /var/log/www/server.log"</p>

							<h2>Background</h2>
							<h3>What is musicco?</h3>
							<p>musicco is a small web application that lets you browse your music library and queue tracks<br/>
							All of this from a browser<br/>
							It's not revolutionary, it just solves a few very specific problems I had...</p>
							<h3>So why did you make musicco?</h3>
							<p>I was tired of syncing music onto devices, only to realise it takes forever or I forgot the particular album I wanted to listen to at home that day. Commercial music streaming services are all fine, but what about that obscure album I bought from a band at a show that I listen to and nobody knows about? What about the music I spent ages ripping from CDs at high bitrate? Oh, and don't get me started on id3 tags, my library is properly organised in Artist &gt; Album folders, I don't need to worry about wrongly-tagged files or players that don't sort tags properly.</p>
							<h3>How does it work?</h3>
							<p>The concept behind musicco is nothing new. In fact, it is largely inspired by <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/henrik242/musicbrowser">musicbrowser</a>, another cool, lightweight music streaming solution.</p>
							<p>It is also technically based on <a target="_blank" href="http://encode-explorer.siineiolekala.net/">encode explorer</a>, a simple and efficient PHP file browser.</p>
							<p>The rest of the work was just putting a UI on top of a HTML5 audio player to create playlists and integrate cover art, artist and lyrics information (from <a href="http://coverartarchive.org/">Cover Art Archive</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> and <a href="http://www.chartlyrics.com/">ChartLyrics</a>).</p>
